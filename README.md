# The Xerty Meter

The Xerty Meter (TXM) is a Game that is based on a percentage of how "Xerty" are you.

## Requirments
* Python 3 & pip.

## Installation

You don't actually have to install TXM. It's standalone. Follow the tutorial below.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/LukewarmCat/xerty
cd xerty/frontend
pip install -r requirements.txt
python3 main.py
```
Use `python3 main.py` every time you want to launch TXM.

If you get any errors about TCL / tkinter not existing, please check if you're not using python 2.
But, if you're on python 3, and this error happens, then please install TCL/tk. This can be done by reinstalling python3 and selecting the
TCL/tk option.
## Usage
Simply, register, and do whatever you want!
